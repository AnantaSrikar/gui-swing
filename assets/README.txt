Here's the basic outline and instructions on how to operate the application

The application opens in the HomePage, containing three buttons listed:
-README (which you already pressed to get here)
-Market
-Source Code

The Market button gets you to the main chart page, displaying the latest trends in the cryptocurrency markets.
The Source Code button will redirect you to the Github Organization webpage, where all the source code for this application can be found.

Market Page:

	Each coin/crypto market can be accessed by the tabbed panes, each tab marked with it's respective crypto coin
	The panel shows a bunch of simple information, such as value 
		-Trends over time(last 50 transactions)
		-Highest value(24h)
		-Low value(24h)
		-Latest value(24h)
		-Volume
		-Buy and Sell value at that time
	
	The page also has a refresh button to regenerate and refresh up-to-date values of the market.
	
	Don't worry if the application charts takes time or freezes, that's completely normal.
	It takes a bit of time for the API call and data acquisition.
	
Thanks for using our application, it's rudimentary as of now, but we've got bigger plans in the future.

Live Long and HODL.
